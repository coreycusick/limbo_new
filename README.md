# Limbo Reborn Project


Limbo Reborn is a continuation of the classic Limbo project, based in part off the original and also from wasdwasd0105's version with Tensor KVM support. This project will likely not support KVM. The goals of this project will be listed
at the bottom under the Planned Features section. I do plan to keep SDL support, but much of the overall UI will be rewritten, and the QEMU version will be updated to the latest version. ARM, PowerPC and x86(or x64) are the only planned supported platforms.




## Planned Features
- [ ] New, hopefully better UI
- [ ] Make ARM version actually work(broken as initially this project was going to support KVM, but due to changes needed, this is likely not happening)
- [ ] UEFI support for ARM and x86_64
- [ ] Different way to create VMs with a more UTM like approach
- [ ] Add manual configuration options that override menu options
- [ ] Combine all separate VM apps into one.
- [ ] GL support(Will be before spice, assuming it can be done through VNC)
- [ ] Spice(hopefully)
